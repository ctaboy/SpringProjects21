The aim of this term project was to build and evaluate one of the language technologies discussed in class. 

I chose to write a finite-state grapheme-to-phoneme conversion grammar for French using Pynini, 
then I evaluated it against a French pronunciation dictionary from WikiPron (see 'fre_dev.tsv').
